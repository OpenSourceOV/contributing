# Todo

## Capture

- [x] Higher magnification and better optics for the clamp hardware (wider and more clear field of view)
  - Version 2 clamp now online - see [build repo](https://github.com/OpenSourceOV/clamp-build-instructions/blob/master/version-2.md) for details!
- [ ] Adjustable magnification - for close up and larger view
- [ ] Faster and simpler ways to attach the sample
- [ ] In-situ configuration – device water-proofing, etc.
- [ ] Pi zero integration
- [ ] Arduino integration
- [ ] Larger device for capturing patterns of embolism across the entire leaf.
- [ ] Clamp attachment for mobile phone with app to control sequence capture (and processing?)
- [ ] Integrated touchscreen display (e.g. [official touchscreen display](https://thepihut.com/products/official-raspberry-pi-7-touchscreen-display?variant=4916536388))

## Process

- [ ] Better/faster/alternative methods of noise removal
- [ ] Better/faster/alternative methods of extracting embolism events
- [ ] Real-time processing during the capture stage


## Analyze

- [ ] Real-time analysis during the processing stage
- [ ] Guides and protocols for dealing with ‘difficult’ sequences
- [ ] Scripts for generating figures for publication (events over time, events by vein order etc.)
- [ ] Better/faster/alternative/automated methods of analysing captured sequences
